### 1\. Protocol üåê

* **Module:** `protocol`
* **Depends on:** N/A
* **Resources:** The official [Minecraft protocol wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_protocol/Packets) is your
  bible.
  It details every packet format, data type, and the connection state flow (handshake, status, login, play).
* **What you should look at:**
    * **Data Types:** Minecraft uses specific data types like **VarInt** (variable-length integers) and **NBT** (Named
      Binary Tag). You will need to implement functions to read and write these from byte buffers.
    * **Packet Structures:** Each message sent between the client and server is a packet. You'll need to create Kotlin
      data classes that model these packets and a system for mapping packet IDs to their corresponding data classes.
    * **Packet I/O:** Implement a binary reader and writer. This is the core logic that will convert raw byte streams
      into meaningful Kotlin objects and vice versa.

### 2\. Networking üîó

* **Module:** `networking`
* **Depends on:** `protocol`
* **Resources:** Libraries like **Ktor** and **Netty** are excellent choices. Ktor, from JetBrains, is a native Kotlin
  framework that uses coroutines, making it a great fit for a pure Kotlin project. Netty is a powerful, battle-tested
  Java networking framework.
* **What you should look at:**
    * **Server Socket:** Set up a server that listens on the default Minecraft port (`25565`).
    * **Connection Management:** Handle incoming connections, managing the lifecycle of each player connection. This
      includes tasks like session creation, keeping track of connection state, and gracefully handling disconnections.
    * **Asynchronous I/O:** Use Kotlin's coroutines to handle I/O without blocking threads. This is crucial for
      performance, as a single thread can manage hundreds or thousands of concurrent connections. You'll use `suspend`
      functions to read and write data to the network.

### 3\. Server Core üß†

* **Module:** `core`
* **Depends on:** `networking`, `protocol`, `plugin-api` (if you are building it alongside)
* **Resources:** Knowledge of game development concepts like game loops, entity-component systems, and event handling is
  key.
* **What you should look at:**
    * **The Game Loop:** This is a crucial concept. The server operates on a fixed tick rate (typically 20 ticks per
      second). The game loop processes all pending actions for that tick. This includes player movements, entity AI, and
      block updates.
    * **World Management:** Create data structures to represent your world. Chunks are a fundamental unit in Minecraft.
      You'll need to load, save, and manage the state of these chunks. This is where you'll store block data, biomes,
      and other world-specific information.
    * **Entity System:** Manage players, mobs, and other non-block entities. This system tracks their position, health,
      inventory, and behavior. You'll need a way to efficiently query and update entities.

### 4\. API & Plugins üîå

* **Module:** `plugin-api`
* **Depends on:** N/A
* **Resources:** Good API design principles are essential. Think about what a plugin developer needs to access and
  change without breaking the core server.
* **What you should look at:**
    * **Event System:** Implement a robust event bus. The core module will dispatch events (e.g., `PlayerJoinEvent`,
      `BlockBreakEvent`), and plugins can register listeners to react to them. This is the primary way plugins will
      interact with your server.
    * **Command System:** Provide an API for plugins to register new commands. This should handle parsing command
      arguments and executing the appropriate plugin logic.
    * **Public Interfaces:** Define public interfaces for accessing core components like the `World`, `Player`, and
      `Inventory`. **Do not expose the internal implementation**; only provide the necessary methods for a plugin to
      function.

### 5\. Application üñ•Ô∏è

* **Module:** `server`
* **Depends on:** `networking`, `core`, `plugin-api`
* **Resources:** Your build tool, like **Gradle**, will be key here.
* **What you should look at:**
    * **Main Class:** This module will contain the `main` function that starts your server.
    * **Configuration:** Handle server settings from a file (e.g., `server.properties`). This includes things like the
      MOTD, server port, and max players.
    * **Dependency Injection:** Use a lightweight DI framework like **Koin** to wire your modules together. This makes
      the codebase more testable and easier to manage.
